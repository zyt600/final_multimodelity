This zip file contains a text file 'howto100m_videos.txt' containing a list of 
links per video. If you only want to download a subset of the videos,
just keep the videos urls that you are interested in.

To download the videos, just run:

wget --user user --password password -i howto100m_videos.txt
wget --user htlog23 --password fb93dc3b1950d18 -i howto100m_videos.txt
(replace user and password by your given credentials).

This will download 1.2M of videos for a total of 12.5Tb.
Please also use a single machine to download the data.

Speed-up note: some people notice download speed ups when replacing the video urls with HTTPS instead of HTTP. Please consider that if you find the downloading slow.
